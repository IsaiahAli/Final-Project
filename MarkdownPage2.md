_St.Louis is the place to grow up_

**St Louis County** is the place that nobody wants to be. An St Louis is separated by the two. They say that one area is bad compared to the other which is true to some extent. It might be reason that St Louis is considered to be as bad as it is. But coming from St Louis County I hate when people disrespect it. It is bad places in every city just St Louis County takes most of the blame for the whole city.

**Reasons that St Louis County Shouldn't take the blame for everything**

1. There is murder everywhere in **STL**
2. Its basically on the verge of being in Illinois so they could take credit for it
3. Just St Louis as a whole needs to come together and figure this out.

#### This is another example of what _St Louis County_ looks like. 
Its not the best per say but its nice enough to live there and grow up there. I wouldn't trade it in for anything else in the world.
