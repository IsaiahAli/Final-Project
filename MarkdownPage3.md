#### **Work Experience**

**Nine Network**
I have experience working at the Nine Network of Public Media. Where we used the software Final Cut Pro to edit and create interviews. From working at that firm I learned how to work better as a team member. Also I became a better leader leading most of my project.

**REJIS**
Also I worked at and am still currently working at REJIS. It is a technology company that works with the government and the police in the state. What I do there is create and edit videos for there website. I learned more about learning on the fly and how to work with people older than me.
