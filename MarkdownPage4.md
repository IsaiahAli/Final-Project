# Why I picked Mizzou

### The real reason I picked Mizzou

It wasn't because its the best school to go to its because its close to home. Its not because I missed my parents or anything. Its because over this summer my **grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and my mom was diagnosed with lupus.** Not being able to see them everyday and take care of them is hard but its easier to know that I can go back every weekend and see them. Which is the real reason I picked **Mizzou.**

**Other advantages to going to Mizzou**
- Networking
- Great Teachers
- Lovely Campus for the Price
- Resources
