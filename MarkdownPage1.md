# My Life Story
## This first page will be about my life story per say.

**Some background on Me as a person**

My name is **Isaiah Hassan Ali.** I'm from a small home in _St Louis City._ Where growing up was hard but I made it work. Living with Just my mother and my step father I learned how hard you have to work for things in life no matter what. An Also I learned to never give up no matter what the circumstances may be. An to also work hard for anything you may desire in life.

*List of things that I learned Growing up*

- How to save money
- How to never take anything for granted
- To always put your family first over Hall
