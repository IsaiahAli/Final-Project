# My Family (Support System)

## My support system during college

### **This Page is More History on Me**

This something that I don't tell everyone but I might as well let you guys know. Out of everyone in my family **no male has graduated from college.** A lot have went but non have every graduated with a degree in anything. So my support system is really what keeps me going in college because of how much they support me. I could have said I am going to college for something stupid and they would have supported me. 

##### **My Five Things that Keep me in College**

- My Mother
- Competition
- My Drive to be successful
- Every Male in my family
- My Friends because we have the same goals.

 An Example of what my **support system** looks like but not my actually support system.

 Even though my support system is mainly **females.**

If you don't have a **support system** make sure you find one. An it doesn't have to be big it could be like three people . But that's good enough, you just need to have people in your corner that want you to succeed because when you do the feeling is just that much better.
